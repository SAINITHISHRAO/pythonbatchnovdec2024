Debugging in Python is the process of identifying and fixing bugs or errors in your code. 
It involves identifying where the problem lies and correcting it to ensure the program runs as expected.

Steps to Debugging:
1. understand the Error Message:
When Python encounters an issue, it raises an error with a message and a stack trace.
Read the message carefully to identify the type of error (e.g., SyntaxError, TypeError, IndexError) and where it occurred.

2. Add Print Statements:
Insert print() statements at key points in your code to see the flow and values of variables.

3. Use the Debugger (pdb):
Python provides a built-in debugger module called pdb.
You can add import pdb; pdb.set_trace() to pause the program and inspect variables interactively.

4. Run in Debug Mode (IDE):
If using an IDE like PyCharm, VS Code, or Jupyter, you can run the program in "Debug Mode."
It allows you to set breakpoints (where the code pauses) and step through line by line.

5. Check for Logical Errors:
The program runs without errors but produces incorrect results.
Test with different inputs and compare expected vs actual output.
